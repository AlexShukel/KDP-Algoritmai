# Brute force solver

Current implementation is very computationally expensive, so it's suitable for problem instances of size <= 6.

## Possible optimizations:

1. Memoization (Caching Sub-problems) for generateAllVehicleRoutes
2. Integrate Route Generation with Simulation
3. Pre-calculate distance matrix

## Things to consider:

1. If solution not found consider to increase maxTotalDistance till some solution found?
